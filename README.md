# The Miserables

Hackathon project to develop an app or video game within 48h.

Made in LibGDX, our team decided to go for a Stealth Maze video game. On each level the player has to escape the guards and free all of his companions so that they can all escape prison together.

Was responsible for designing the sprites, implementing them, implementing some of the sounds and music, worked around some of the character's logic and behaviour and helped a bit in trying to implement some of the game's menus as well as the maps.
